# SoC2022
I haven't yet started coding on the main project, but was practising on the assignments that we were told to solve in the courses that we were told to do and learn till now.
Till now, I had gone through courses
- **ML crash** by google which covers the basics of ML
- **Udacity** course on Tensorflow which covers the implememtation of neural networks (basic and CNNs) in tensorflow
- Had gone through the provided resources on **ResNet**, which has information about it along with its implementation
- Had gone through the provided resources on **GANs**, which has information about it along with its implementation
- Currently I'm learning about **Sequence Models** by going through one of the course offered by Deeplearning.ai as part of Deep learning specialization
